# 📊 E-commerce Profitability & P&L Analysis

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes the profitability dynamics of a simulated D2C e-commerce business.

The goal is not only to track revenue, but to understand whether growth actually translates into profit and sustainable business performance.

The analysis focuses on:
- Revenue vs Profit dynamics  
- Discount impact on margins  
- Contribution and net profitability  
- Cost structure visibility  
- Profitability drivers

## 🎯 Business Objective

In e-commerce, revenue growth alone does not guarantee success.

This project aims to answer:

- Is growth profitable?  
- What drives margin pressure?  
- How do discounts affect profitability?  
- How does cost structure shape net profit?

## 📈 Key Analyses

### 1️⃣ Revenue vs Profit Trend
Compares top-line growth to bottom-line performance to detect margin pressure.

### 2️⃣ Discount Impact Analysis
Evaluates how different discount levels influence profitability and unit economics.

### 3️⃣ P&L Analysis
Builds a simplified Profit & Loss structure including:
- Revenue  
- COGS  
- Marketing Costs  
- Contribution Profit  
- Fixed Costs  
- Net Profit  

### 4️⃣ P&L Waterfall Chart
Visualizes how revenue is reduced step-by-step by costs to arrive at net profit.

This helps identify where optimization has the greatest impact.
